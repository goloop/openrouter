- Native `ChatCompletion` and `ChatCompletionStream` exposing the full chat
  option set.

- Functional options: `WithBaseURL`, `WithHTTPClient`, `WithTimeout`,
  `WithMaxRetries`, `WithHeader`, plus `WithReferer` and `WithTitle` for
  app attribution.
- Retries on 429 and 5xx with backoff; normalized `*ai.APIError` errors.
