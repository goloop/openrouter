# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-11

Patch release.

### Documentation
- The reference covers the driver's `Capabilities` and the translation of
  model-level 400 refusals into `ai.ErrNoHosted`/`ai.ErrNoFormat`, which until
  now lived only in the godoc.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-11

Minor release, on `ai` v1.1.0.

### Added
- `Capabilities` describes what this driver can be asked for. It reports no
  hosted capability, which is the same answer `ai.Request.Hosted` already gets
  from this driver, now available before the call instead of only as an error
  after it. A test pins the two together.
- A provider refusal that means "this model cannot produce that format" is now
  translated into `ai.ErrNoFormat`, so an application degrades with one
  `errors.Is` instead of matching English prose in an error message. The
  provider's own `ai.APIError` is wrapped, not replaced, and stays reachable
  with `errors.As`. The rules are deliberately narrow - only a 400, only a
  format the caller asked for, only an error naming that exact field - because
  mistaking a genuinely bad request for a missing feature would retry it
  forever.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-11

First stable release, on `ai` v1.0.0.

### Added
- `ai.Request.Hosted` is answered with `ai.ErrNoHosted` before the request
  leaves, because the provider routes to models rather than serving one, so a hosted search
  depends on the route behind a request rather than on the provider.
  That refusal is the documented behavior rather than a gap left in silence:
  an answer produced without the search that was asked for looks exactly like
  one produced with it, so failing loudly is the only way a caller can tell
  them apart. A caller who would rather have the answer anyway asks again
  without `Hosted`.
- Tests pin it, including that nothing is sent to the provider.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-05

### Documentation
- The package documentation describes how `ai.Request.Format` reaches this
  provider, so it is on the first page a reader sees rather than only in the
  reference.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-05

Released by mistake: it carries this changelog entry and nothing else. The
documentation it describes landed in 0.2.2.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- `ai.Request.Format` is mapped onto the provider's own `response_format`, so a request
  for JSON is enforced by the provider rather than merely asked for, and
  `ai.Response.JSON` decodes the reply. `Response.Format` reports
  `ai.FormatNative`. Until now only this package's native request type could
  ask for JSON, so callers going through the provider-agnostic interface had
  to strip code fences from the reply by hand.
- Plain JSON mode also appends `ai.Format.Instruction()` to the system prompt,
  because this wire format rejects `json_object` unless the word "json" appears
  in the messages. The caller's own system prompt is kept and the instruction
  follows it; schema mode leaves the prompt untouched.

### Changed
- Requires `github.com/goloop/ai` v0.4.0.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Require `goloop/ai` v0.2.0 (500 no longer retried; jittered backoff).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-09

Initial release, built on the `github.com/goloop/ai` interface.

### Added
- `Client` implementing `ai.Client`: `Generate` and streaming `Stream` over
  chat completions, with tool use, multimodal image input and system prompts.
- Native `ChatCompletion` and `ChatCompletionStream` exposing the full chat
  option set.
- Model listing (`Models`) and single-model lookup (`GetModel`).
- Functional options: `WithBaseURL`, `WithHTTPClient`, `WithTimeout`,
  `WithMaxRetries`, `WithHeader`, plus `WithReferer` and `WithTitle` for
  app attribution.
- Retries on 429 and 5xx with backoff; normalized `*ai.APIError` errors.
