# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-05

### Documentation
- The package documentation describes how `ai.Request.Format` reaches this
  provider, so it is on the first page a reader sees rather than only in the
  reference.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- `ai.Request.Format` is mapped onto the provider's own `response_format`, so a request
  for JSON is enforced by the provider rather than merely asked for, and
  `ai.Response.JSON` decodes the reply. `Response.Format` reports
  `ai.FormatNative`. Until now only this package's native request type could
  ask for JSON, so callers going through the provider-agnostic interface had
  to strip code fences from the reply by hand.
- Plain JSON mode also appends `ai.Format.Instruction()` to the system prompt,
  because this wire format rejects `json_object` unless the word "json" appears
  in the messages. The caller's own system prompt is kept and the instruction
  follows it; schema mode leaves the prompt untouched.

### Changed
- Requires `github.com/goloop/ai` v0.4.0.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Require `goloop/ai` v0.2.0 (500 no longer retried; jittered backoff).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-09

Initial release, built on the `github.com/goloop/ai` interface.

### Added
- `Client` implementing `ai.Client`: `Generate` and streaming `Stream` over
  chat completions, with tool use, multimodal image input and system prompts.
- Native `ChatCompletion` and `ChatCompletionStream` exposing the full chat
  option set.
- Model listing (`Models`) and single-model lookup (`GetModel`).
- Functional options: `WithBaseURL`, `WithHTTPClient`, `WithTimeout`,
  `WithMaxRetries`, `WithHeader`, plus `WithReferer` and `WithTitle` for
  app attribution.
- Retries on 429 and 5xx with backoff; normalized `*ai.APIError` errors.
