## Mental model

`openrouter.Client` implements `ai.Client`, the provider-agnostic contract from
`github.com/goloop/ai`. OpenRouter is a routing gateway - one API and key reach
many model providers, with models namespaced as `provider/model`. The shared
`Generate` and `Stream` cover the common ground - chat with tools, images and
streaming - so code written against the interface runs on any provider.

The wire format is chat-completions compatible; native power lives in
`ChatCompletion` and model listing.

```go
import (
	"github.com/goloop/ai"
	"github.com/goloop/openrouter"
)
```

## Creating a client

```go
c := openrouter.New(os.Getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY"))

c = openrouter.New(apiKey,
	openrouter.WithReferer("https://myapp.example"),
	openrouter.WithTitle("My App"),
)
```

The base URL defaults to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`.

## Generate and Stream

```go
resp, err := c.Generate(ctx, &ai.Request{
	Model:    openrouter.ModelClaudeSonnet,
	System:   "You are concise.",
	Messages: []ai.Message{ai.UserText("Name three primary colors.")},
})
resp.Text()
resp.ToolCalls()
resp.Usage
```

`Stream` returns `iter.Seq2[ai.Chunk, error]`: text deltas as chunks with
`Text`, a finished tool call as a chunk with `ToolCall`, and a final chunk with
`Done` and `Usage`.

## Structured output

`ai.Request.Format` maps onto the provider's own `response_format`, so a request for JSON
is enforced by the provider rather than merely asked for:

```go
resp, err := c.Generate(ctx, &ai.Request{
	Model:    "the-model",
	Messages: []ai.Message{ai.UserText("Draft SEO fields for this article.")},
	Format: &ai.Format{
		Type:   ai.FormatJSONSchema,
		Name:   "seo",
		Schema: schema,
	},
})

var seo SEO
err = resp.JSON(&seo)
```

`ai.FormatJSON` goes out as `{"type":"json_object"}` and `ai.FormatJSONSchema`
as `{"type":"json_schema", ...}`. Plain JSON mode also appends
`ai.Format.Instruction()` to the system prompt: this wire format rejects
`json_object` unless the word "json" appears in the messages. Your own system
prompt is kept and the instruction follows it; schema mode leaves it untouched.


`ai.Response.Format` is `ai.FormatNative`: this provider enforces every shape
it accepts. Which models support schema mode is the provider's business - there
is no capability table here, so an unsupported pairing is reported by the
provider itself.

## Native chat completions

For provider-only options build a `ChatRequest` and call `ChatCompletion` or
`ChatCompletionStream`:

```go
resp, err := c.ChatCompletion(ctx, &openrouter.ChatRequest{
	Model:          openrouter.ModelGPT4o,
	Messages:       []openrouter.ChatMessage{{Role: "user", Content: "as JSON"}},
	ResponseFormat: json.RawMessage(`{"type":"json_object"}`),
})
```

## App attribution

`WithReferer` and `WithTitle` set the `HTTP-Referer` and `X-Title` headers that
OpenRouter uses to attribute and rank traffic per application. Both are
optional.

## Tools, images and system prompts

Tool use, images and system prompts use the shared `ai` types: `ai.Tool`,
`ai.Image`, `ai.ToolResult` and a `RoleSystem` message or the `System` field.
Tool results are sent back as `RoleTool` messages whose `ai.ToolResult.ID`
matches the `ai.ToolUse.ID`. Inline image bytes are sent as a base64 data URI.

## Models

Any `provider/model` string works; constants such as `ModelGPT4o`,
`ModelClaudeSonnet` and `ModelGeminiFlash` are provided for convenience.

```go
models, err := c.Models(ctx)
models[0].ID            // "openai/gpt-4o"
models[0].ContextLength
```

## Hosted web search

`ai.Request.Hosted` is answered with `ai.ErrNoHosted` before the request
leaves.

This provider routes to models rather than serving one, so what a request can do
depends on the route behind it, and a hosted search is a routing feature rather
than a tool the model is offered. There is no answer this package can give for
the provider as a whole, and answering per route would be a capability table
that is wrong the week a route changes.

The refusal is the documented behavior, not a gap left in silence: an answer
produced without the search that was asked for looks exactly like one produced
with it, so failing loudly is the only way you can tell them apart. If you would
rather have the answer anyway, ask again without `Hosted`.

## Capabilities and model-level refusals

This driver implements `ai.Capable` and reports no hosted capability - the
same answer `ai.Request.Hosted` already gets here, now available before the
call instead of only as an error after it. A conformance test pins the two
together.

A refusal the provider reports only as a 400 - "this model cannot produce that
format" - now arrives wrapped in `ai.ErrNoFormat`, so one `errors.Is` replaces
matching English prose in an error message; the provider's own `ai.APIError`
stays reachable with `errors.As`. The wrapping is deliberately narrow: only a
400, only a format the request actually asked for, only an error naming that
exact field.

## Options and errors

Options: `WithBaseURL`, `WithHTTPClient`, `WithTimeout`, `WithMaxRetries`,
`WithHeader`, `WithReferer`, `WithTitle`.

A non-success response becomes an `*ai.APIError` with `Status`, `Type`, `Code`,
`Message` and the raw body:

```go
var apiErr *ai.APIError
if errors.As(err, &apiErr) && apiErr.Status == http.StatusTooManyRequests {
	// back off
}
```

Requests missing a model or messages fail before the network with
`ai.ErrNoModel` or `ai.ErrNoMessages`.
